{"reviewRef":"refs/heads/ojarjur/remove-pull-requests-hack","targetRef":"refs/heads/master","requester":"ojarjur@google.com","reviewers":["amshali@google.com","astroilov@google.com"],"description":"Removed a buggy patch that was being applied to Phabricator for fetching from the remote repo.\n\nThis was added in order to support reviewing GitHub pull requests (under the refs/pulls namespace), but no one was actually using it.\n\nThe bug this introduced was that it force fetched *all* refs from the remote, including those under refs/notes/devtools/... causing\nthe remote refs to overwrite local changes (such as those written by the git-phabricator mirror).\n\nIf we decide to try this again in the future, then we should be more selective, and either:\n1. Only pull heads and pull requests from the remote.\nor\n2. Only *force* pull the heads, and fast-forward pull everything else."}
