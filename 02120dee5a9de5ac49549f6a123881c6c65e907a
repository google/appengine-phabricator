Automating that process proved problematic, so instead\nthe user will only inject the name of the Cloud SQL instance, and the Docker\ncontainer will set the root password on that instance using the gcloud tool.\n\nThis has the downside of tying our Docker image to Cloud SQL, but in exchange\nfor that we get to make our installation process more automated and repeatable."}
