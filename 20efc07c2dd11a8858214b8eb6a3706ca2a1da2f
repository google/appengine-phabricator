Install the gerrit credential helper into the new location of the gcloud bin directory.\n2.  Move the addition of the gitconfig up to the same section of the Dockerfile that was adding the credentials helpers.\n3.  Link the installed credential helpers into the same names under the /usr/local/bin directory, to ensure that they are in the PATH of any process that needs them."}
